`const` keyword is used to create immutable values, the only thing is these values needs to be defined at compile time.

`const` keyword has to be used with `val` keyword to create a variable. `const val` are only allowed on top level, in named objects, or in companion objects, which means it cannot be defined locally inside of functions and classes.


**Syntax for const:**


```kotlin
 const val <variable_name> = <value>
```


**Example:**


```kotlin
 const val name = "Sayok"
```


Variable defined with the `const` keyword needs to be initiated before the code is compiled, as the value stored in a `const` variable will be directly put in the source code during compilation.

To understand what is meant by the above line we need to see what happens when we use a  `const val` in Kotlin and decompile it in Java.


**Kotlin Code :**

```kotlin
object Constants {
    val name = "Sayok"
    const val petName = "Neil"
}

fun main() {
    println("${Constants.name} ${Constants.petName}")
}
```


**Decompiled Java Code:**

```java
public final class Constants {

   public static final Constants INSTANCE = new Constants();
  
   private static final String name = "Sayok";
   
   public static final String petName = "Neil";

   public final String getName() {
      return name;
   }
}

 public static final void main() {
      System.out.println(Constants.INSTANCE.getName() + " Neil");
 }
```


So in the above code you will see the variable `petName`â€™s value is directly replaced in the print statement where the variable is used.


<mark>**\*Note-**</mark>`const val` only supports primitive data types as mentioned below":

| Supported data types |
|----|
| byte |
| short |
| int |
| long |
| double |
| float |
| char |
| Sting |
| boolean |
