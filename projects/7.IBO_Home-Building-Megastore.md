###  Overview

The **IBO Production App** was designed to provide users with a seamless multi-category shopping experience — allowing them to browse products, discover local stores, manage their wallet, and enjoy a personalized theme-based interface.

I was responsible for **key feature development and UI implementation**, including skeleton loading states, dark/light theme architecture, wallet page creation, animated UI elements, and store detail pages. The project leverages both **Jetpack Compose** and **XML with MotionLayout** to create a visually rich and performant user experience.

###  Key Highlights

####  Skeleton View on Loading
- Implemented **skeleton loading screens** to enhance perceived performance and user experience.
- Created shimmer effects and placeholder layouts that mirror actual content structure.
- Reduced perceived wait time and improved engagement during data loading states.

####  Dark and Light Themes
- Designed and implemented **comprehensive dark and light theme support** for personalized app theming.
- Created a consistent theming system across all screens and components.
- Ensured proper contrast ratios and accessibility standards for both theme modes.
- Enabled seamless theme switching without app restart.

####  Wallet Page in Jetpack Compose
- Created a **complete wallet management page** using Jetpack Compose for efficient UI rendering.
- Implemented wallet balance display, transaction history, and payment integration.
- Built modern, reactive UI components following Material Design guidelines.
- Ensured smooth animations and state management for wallet operations.

####  Multiple Animations with XML and MotionLayout
- Incorporated **rich animations throughout the app** using both XML and MotionLayout.
- Created smooth transitions between screens and interactive element animations.
- Implemented custom MotionLayout scenes for complex animation sequences.
- Enhanced user engagement with delightful micro-interactions and visual feedback.

####  Store Details Pages
- Designed and implemented **comprehensive store detail pages** for seamless browsing experience.
- Created product listings, store information sections, and navigation to store catalogs.
- Built responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.
- Integrated with backend APIs for real-time store data and inventory updates.

####  Hybrid UI Architecture
- Utilized a **hybrid approach** combining Jetpack Compose for modern screens and XML for complex animations.
- Leveraged MotionLayout for advanced animation choreography and interactive transitions.
- Ensured seamless interoperability between Compose and traditional View-based UI.

###  Architecture

The app follows **MVVM Architecture** layered into:

| Layer | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| **UI (Presentation)** | Built with Jetpack Compose and XML Views, driven by ViewModels observing `LiveData` and `StateFlow`. |
| **Domain** | Contains use cases for shopping, wallet operations, and store management. |
| **Data** | Manages API calls via Retrofit and local caching with Room. |
| **DI Layer** | Managed using **Dagger/Hilt** for dependency injection and modularity. |

**Flow Example:**
`UI → ViewModel → UseCase → Repository → API/DB → Repository → ViewModel → UI`
