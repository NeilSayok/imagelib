### 📱 KPN App

The **KPN App** is the official customer-facing mobile application developed for **Kovai Pazhamudir Nilayam (KPN)** — one of South India’s leading retail chains for fruits, vegetables, and grocery essentials.  
Built entirely from scratch, the app delivers a seamless shopping experience with smart outlet selection, real-time updates, and a dynamic, in-house server-driven UI.

---

### 🚀 Overview

The **KPN App** was designed to bring the brand’s physical retail experience into the digital space — allowing users to browse products, select nearby outlets, and stay connected to KPN’s latest offerings.  

I was responsible for **end-to-end development**, covering architecture design, UI creation, backend integration, and app optimization. The project was built with **Jetpack Compose**, leveraging **modern Android architecture** to ensure scalability, performance, and maintainability.

### ✨ Key Highlights

#### 🏗️ Built from Scratch
- Designed and implemented **complete app architecture** using **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**.  
- Established a scalable **MVVM + Clean Architecture** setup for better separation of concerns and easier feature expansion.

#### 🔀 Navigation Architecture
- Developed a **custom navigation system** using **Jetpack Navigation Components**, ensuring smooth and predictable transitions between screens.  
- Added back stack handling, argument passing, and deep link support.

#### 🧱 Jetpack Compose UI
- Created **all UI components** using Jetpack Compose for faster development, better performance, and reactive updates.  
- Built modular Composables for reusable cards, banners, buttons, and list items to maintain visual consistency.  
- Applied **Material 2 components** with a unified color and typography system (no dynamic theming).

#### 🧩 Designed and Built Server-Driven UI (In-House)
- Developed a **fully in-house server-driven UI system** from the ground up.  
- The system allows layouts and content to be defined via server configuration, rendered dynamically on the client.  
- Implemented JSON-based schema parsing to construct Compose components on-the-fly.  
- Significantly reduced release dependency by enabling **real-time UI updates** directly from the backend.  
- Ensured flexibility for marketing and content teams to manage visual layouts without code-level changes.

#### 📍 Location Services Integration
- Integrated **dual mapping support** — dynamically switching between **Google Maps** and **OpenStreetMap (OSM)** based on configuration keys.  
- Built a **custom in-house Places API** to handle outlet search, distance calculation, and location-based outlet discovery.  
- Added runtime permission handling and intelligent fallbacks for denied location permissions.

#### 🔔 Push Messaging & Notifications
- **Push Messaging:** Implemented internal app messaging for operational updates such as delivery location changes, order status updates, and staff-to-staff communication.  
- **Push Notifications:** Integrated **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** to deliver personalized offers, updates, and order status alerts externally.  
- Implemented topic-based and token-based notifications for efficient delivery and segmentation.

#### 💫 Performance & User Experience
- Optimized startup time and reduced unnecessary recompositions using **Compose best practices**.  
- Implemented **lazy-loading and caching** for banners and product lists.  
- Ensured **responsive layouts** across different screen sizes and orientations.

### 🧠 Architecture

The app follows **Clean Architecture** layered into:

| Layer | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| **UI (Presentation)** | Built with Jetpack Compose, driven by ViewModels observing `StateFlow` and `LiveData`. |
| **Domain** | Contains use cases and business logic independent of the framework. |
| **Data** | Manages API calls via Retrofit and local storage with Room. |
| **DI Layer** | Managed using **Dagger/Hilt** for dependency injection and modularity. |

**Flow Example:**  
`UI → ViewModel → UseCase → Repository → API/DB → Repository → ViewModel → UI`
