###  Vehicle Tracker - Car Tracking System

**Vehicle Tracker** is a comprehensive vehicle tracking ecosystem consisting of three interconnected components: **Car Tracker App** (tracking device), **Car Locator App** (monitoring device), and a **backend Web API**.
Built to enable real-time vehicle location monitoring, the system allows users to track their vehicles remotely using Android devices with secure OTP-based authentication.

###  Overview

The **Vehicle Tracker** system was designed as a complete end-to-end vehicle tracking solution — allowing users to place an Android device in their vehicle (running the Car Tracker App) and monitor its real-time location from another device (running the Car Locator App).

I developed this as a **multi-component ecosystem** including two Android applications and a custom backend API. The system features **background location tracking**, **real-time vehicle status monitoring** (online/offline), **OTP-based user authentication**, and **Google Maps integration** for visual location display.

###  System Architecture

The Vehicle Tracker ecosystem consists of three main components:

####  Car Tracker App (Tracking Device)
The app installed on the device placed inside the vehicle:
- Continuously tracks device GPS location in the background
- Sends location data to the server at regular intervals
- Handles user signup and OTP verification
- Runs as a foreground service with persistent notification
- Automatically starts tracking after user authentication

####  Car Locator App (Monitoring Device)
The app installed on the user's phone for monitoring:
- Displays list of all registered vehicles
- Shows real-time online/offline status of each vehicle
- Integrates Google Maps to display vehicle locations
- Uses Room Database for local data caching
- Provides vehicle location history and tracking

####  Web API (Backend Server)
Custom PHP backend hosted on Heroku:
- REST API for location data storage and retrieval
- User authentication and vehicle registration
- OTP generation and email verification via SendInBlue SMTP
- ClearDB database for persistent data storage
- Real-time vehicle status management

###  Key Highlights

####  Real-Time Location Tracking
- Implemented **continuous background location tracking** using Android Services.
- Location updates sent to server at regular intervals for real-time monitoring.
- Built with **Fused Location Provider** for accurate GPS coordinates.
- Foreground service ensures tracking continues even when app is in background.

####  OTP-Based User Authentication
- Secure **email-based OTP verification** for user signup and vehicle registration.
- Integrated **SendInBlue SMTP service** for reliable email delivery.
- Token-based authentication for secure API communication.
- Prevents unauthorized access to vehicle tracking data.

####  Google Maps Integration
- **Interactive Google Maps** display in Car Locator App showing vehicle positions.
- Real-time map marker updates when vehicle moves.
- Map centering and zoom controls for better visibility.
- Visual representation of vehicle location history.

####  Vehicle Status Monitoring
- Real-time **online/offline status** indication for each tracked vehicle.
- Displays last known location when vehicle goes offline.
- RecyclerView list showing all registered vehicles with status indicators.
- Automatic status updates based on location data freshness.

####  Foreground Service with Notifications
- **Persistent notification** showing active tracking status in Car Tracker App.
- Ensures tracking service is not killed by the system.
- Notification provides quick access to stop tracking.
- Battery-optimized background processing.

####  Local Data Caching
- **Room Database** integration in Car Locator App for offline access.
- Caches vehicle data and locations for faster app performance.
- Reduces network calls and improves user experience.
- Synchronized with backend when online.

####  Modern UI with Animations
- Integrated **Lottie animations** for enhanced visual feedback.
- MotionLayout transitions for smooth UI interactions.
- ConstraintLayout for responsive, flexible layouts.
- Material Design components throughout both apps.

###  Architecture

Both apps follow **MVVM Architecture**:

| Layer | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| **UI (Presentation)** | Built with Fragments and Navigation Architecture, driven by ViewModels observing `LiveData`. |
| **Domain** | Contains use cases for location tracking, vehicle management, and authentication. |
| **Data** | Manages API calls via Retrofit, local caching with Room, and location services. |
| **Service Layer** | Background services for continuous location tracking. |

**System Flow:**
`Car Tracker App → Location Service → Web API → Car Locator App → Google Maps Display`
