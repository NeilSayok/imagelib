###  Weather App

**Weather App** is a location-based weather forecasting application that displays current weather conditions and forecasts for user-selected locations.
Built as a **one-day build challenge** for an interview process, the app demonstrates rapid development capabilities while maintaining clean architecture and modern Android best practices.

###  Overview

The **Weather App** was designed to provide comprehensive weather information for any location — allowing users to check weather via current location, manual coordinate selection, or interactive map pin placement.

I built this app as part of a **technical interview challenge for Waycool**, completing the entire development in **one day**. The project showcases **100% Kotlin**, **multi-module architecture**, and integration with weather APIs and Google Maps to deliver accurate forecasts for the next 48 hours and 7 days.

###  Key Highlights

####  Multiple Location Selection Methods
- **Current Location:** Automatically fetch and display weather for the user's current GPS location.
- **Coordinate Selection:** Manually enter latitude and longitude coordinates to check weather.
- **Map Pin Selection:** Interactive Google Maps integration allowing users to drop pins and check weather at any location on the map.

####  Comprehensive Weather Forecasts
- **48-Hour Forecast:** Hourly weather predictions for the next two days.
- **7-Day Forecast:** Daily weather overview for the next week.
- View detailed weather metrics including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions.

####  Google Maps Integration
- Integrated **Google Maps SDK** for interactive location selection.
- Supports map pin dropping to select custom locations.
- Displays weather overlay on selected map locations.

####  Device Location Services
- Implemented **Fused Location Provider** for accurate current location detection.
- Runtime permission handling for location access.
- Intelligent fallback for denied location permissions.

####  Motion Layout Animations
- Created **smooth, interactive UI animations** using MotionLayout.
- Animated transitions between weather states and forecast views.
- Enhanced user experience with fluid visual feedback.

####  Tabbed Weather Views
- Implemented **View Pager with Tab Layout** for easy navigation between forecast periods.
- Separate tabs for 48-hour and 7-day forecasts.
- Swipe gestures for intuitive forecast browsing.

####  Multi-Module Architecture
- Built as a **multi-module project** for better separation of concerns.
- Modularized components for data, domain, and presentation layers.
- Improved build times and code reusability.

###  Architecture

The app follows **Clean Architecture with MVVM** across multiple modules:

| Layer | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| **UI (Presentation)** | Built with XML Views, MotionLayout, and ViewModels observing `LiveData`. |
| **Domain** | Contains use cases for weather fetching and location management. |
| **Data** | Manages weather API calls via Retrofit and location services. |
| **Multi-Module** | Separate modules for app, data, domain layers for scalability. |

**Flow Example:**
`UI → ViewModel → UseCase → Repository → Weather API/Location Service → Repository → ViewModel → UI`
