### ‚ú® Key Highlights

#### üîÄ Pure Compose Navigation with Deeplink Handling
- Set up a **pure Jetpack Compose navigation system** with seamless deeplink handling.
- Implemented navigation graph for smooth transitions between picking screens, scan results, and order details.
- Added deeplink support to allow push notifications and external triggers to navigate directly to specific screens.

#### üì∑ QR/Barcode Scanner Integration
- Created **in-app QR and barcode scanning functionality** using camera APIs and ML Kit.
- Optimized scanner performance for fast, accurate scans in warehouse lighting conditions.
- Integrated scan results directly into the picking workflow to update order statuses in real-time.

#### üì± Optimized for Zebra Handheld Scanners
- Tailored the app specifically for **Zebra TC series devices** used in warehouse operations.
- Ensured compatibility with Zebra's hardware buttons and built-in barcode scanner functionality.
- Tested and optimized UI layout for smaller handheld screen sizes and touch precision.

#### üîî Complete Push Messaging & Notification System
- **Push Messaging:** Implemented internal app messaging for operational updates such as order assignments, location changes, and staff-to-staff communication.
- **Push Notifications:** Integrated **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** to deliver real-time alerts for new picking tasks, priority orders, and system updates.
- Implemented topic-based and token-based notifications for efficient delivery and segmentation based on warehouse zones and user roles.

#### üß± Jetpack Compose UI
- Created **all UI components** using Jetpack Compose for modern, reactive, and performant interfaces.
- Built modular Composables for order cards, scan overlays, status indicators, and action buttons.
- Applied **Material Design principles** with a clean, functional design optimized for quick interactions.

#### üè† Server-Driven UI for Homepage
- Developed the home page using **Server-Driven UI** for real-time content updates and dynamic layout management.
- Enabled backend teams to update dashboard widgets, priority alerts, and operational messages without app releases.

### üß† Architecture

The app follows **Clean Architecture** layered into:

| Layer | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| **UI (Presentation)** | Built with Jetpack Compose, driven by ViewModels observing `StateFlow`. |
| **Domain** | Contains use cases for scanning, order management, and messaging logic. |
| **Data** | Manages API calls via Retrofit and local caching with Room. |
| **DI Layer** | Managed using **Dagger/Hilt** for dependency injection and modularity. |

**Flow Example:**
`UI ‚Üí ViewModel ‚Üí UseCase ‚Üí Repository ‚Üí API/DB ‚Üí Repository ‚Üí ViewModel ‚Üí UI`
