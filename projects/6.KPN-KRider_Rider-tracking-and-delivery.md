### üöÄ Overview

The **KPN Rider App** was designed to streamline KPN's last-mile delivery operations ‚Äî enabling riders to manage their delivery queue, navigate optimally to customer locations, and automatically share their location with customers in real-time.

I was responsible for **end-to-end development**, covering pure Compose navigation with deeplink handling, QR/barcode scanning, push notification systems, route mapping integration, and real-time location tracking. The project was built with **Jetpack Compose** and leverages **modern Android architecture** to ensure reliability, performance, and battery efficiency during delivery operations.

### ‚ú® Key Highlights

#### üîÄ Pure Compose Navigation with Deeplink Handling
- Set up a **pure Jetpack Compose navigation system** with seamless deeplink handling.
- Implemented navigation graph for smooth transitions between delivery lists, order details, route maps, and customer information.
- Added deeplink support to allow push notifications to navigate directly to specific orders or urgent delivery alerts.

#### üì∑ QR/Barcode Scanner Integration
- Created **in-app QR and barcode scanning functionality** using camera APIs and ML Kit.
- Integrated scanner for order verification, package confirmation, and delivery proof collection.
- Optimized scanner performance for quick scans in various lighting and outdoor conditions.

#### üó∫Ô∏è Route Mapping & Navigation
- Integrated **Google Maps SDK** for comprehensive route mapping and turn-by-turn navigation.
- Implemented **optimal route calculation** for multi-stop deliveries to minimize travel time.
- Added real-time traffic updates and route re-optimization based on current conditions.
- Provided visual route preview before starting deliveries for better planning.
- Enabled offline map caching for uninterrupted navigation in low-connectivity areas.

#### üìç Real-Time Location Tracking
- Implemented **automated location tracking** that triggers API calls every **10 meters of movement**.
- Location updates are sent to the backend, which then pushes real-time rider location to customers via push messages.
- Built battery-optimized location tracking using **Fused Location Provider** with intelligent update intervals.
- Added geofencing to detect delivery zone arrival and notify customers automatically.
- Implemented background location tracking with foreground service notifications for transparency.

#### üîî Complete Push Messaging & Notification System
- **Push Messaging:** Implemented internal app messaging for new order assignments, route changes, and operational alerts.
- **Push Notifications:** Integrated **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** to deliver real-time alerts for priority deliveries, customer requests, and system updates.
- Implemented topic-based and token-based notifications for efficient delivery based on rider zones and availability status.

#### üß± Jetpack Compose UI
- Created **all UI components** using Jetpack Compose for modern, reactive, and performant interfaces.
- Built modular Composables for order cards, delivery status indicators, map overlays, and action buttons.
- Applied **Material Design principles** with a clean, driver-focused design optimized for on-the-go interactions.

#### üè† Server-Driven UI for Homepage
- Developed the home page using **Server-Driven UI** for real-time content updates and dynamic layout management.
- Enabled backend teams to update delivery priorities, announcements, and operational messages without app releases.

### üß† Architecture

The app follows **Clean Architecture** layered into:

| Layer | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| **UI (Presentation)** | Built with Jetpack Compose, driven by ViewModels observing `StateFlow`. |
| **Domain** | Contains use cases for order management, location tracking, route optimization, and scanning logic. |
| **Data** | Manages API calls via Retrofit, location services, and local caching with Room. |
| **DI Layer** | Managed using **Dagger/Hilt** for dependency injection and modularity. |

**Flow Example:**
`UI ‚Üí ViewModel ‚Üí UseCase ‚Üí Repository ‚Üí API/Location Service/DB ‚Üí Repository ‚Üí ViewModel ‚Üí UI`
