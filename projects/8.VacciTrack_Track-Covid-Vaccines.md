### 💉 VacciTrack - Track Covid Vaccines

**VacciTrack** is a COVID-19 vaccine availability tracking application that automatically monitors vaccine slots at user-preferred pin codes using the COWIN API.
Built during the pandemic to help users secure vaccine appointments, the app provides automated tracking with periodic checks and instant notifications when slots become available.

### 🚀 Overview

**VacciTrack** was designed to solve the critical problem of vaccine slot availability during the COVID-19 pandemic — allowing users to monitor multiple pin codes for their preferred age group without manual checking.

I built this app as a **personal project** to help people secure vaccine appointments efficiently. The app automatically fetches data from the **COWIN API** at fixed intervals and notifies users immediately when vaccines become available at their selected pin codes.

### ✨ Key Highlights

#### 🔄 Automated Periodic Checking
- Implemented **automatic vaccine availability checking every 3 hours** using WorkManager.
- Monitors availability for the **next 7 days** from the current date.
- Runs in the background even when the app is closed, ensuring users never miss available slots.

#### 📍 Multi-Pincode Monitoring
- Enabled **multiple pincode tracking** with a custom watchlist feature.
- Users can add unlimited pincodes to their monitoring list.
- Built an intuitive interface to add, view, and remove pincodes from the watchlist.

#### 🎯 Age Group Filtering
- Implemented **age-based filtering** to match user eligibility:
  - **All Age Groups:** 18+ and 45+
  - **Age 45+:** Only 45+ slots
  - **Below 45:** Only 18-45 slots
- Ensures users only receive notifications for relevant vaccine slots.

#### 🔔 Instant Notifications
- Integrated **push notifications** to alert users immediately when vaccines become available.
- Notifications include pincode, vaccination center name, and available slots.
- Background service ensures notifications work even when the app is not active.

#### ⚡ Manual Check Feature
- Added **"Check Now"** functionality for instant availability verification.
- Allows users to check immediately without waiting for the next scheduled interval.
- Provides real-time feedback on current vaccine availability.

#### 🗄️ Local Data Persistence
- Implemented **local storage** using SharedPreferences for pincode watchlist and user preferences.
- Ensures user settings persist across app restarts.
- Fast app startup with cached configuration.

#### 🌐 COWIN API Integration
- Integrated with the official **Government of India COWIN API** for accurate, real-time data.
- Implemented proper API rate limiting and error handling.
- Ensured compliance with COWIN API usage guidelines.

### 🧠 Architecture

The app follows **MVVM Architecture** with background processing:

| Layer | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| **UI (Presentation)** | Built with XML Views and ViewModels observing `LiveData`. |
| **Domain** | Contains use cases for pincode management and vaccine checking logic. |
| **Data** | Manages COWIN API calls via Retrofit and local storage with SharedPreferences. |
| **Background Processing** | Uses WorkManager for periodic vaccine availability checks. |

**Flow Example:**
`WorkManager → Repository → COWIN API → Repository → Notification Service → User`

### 🎯 How to Use

#### Select Age Group
Choose the appropriate age group for vaccine eligibility:
- **All Age Groups:** Includes 18+ and 45+
- **Age 45+:** Only 45+ slots
- **Below 45:** Only 18-45 slots

#### Add Pin Codes to Watchlist
1. Enter a pincode (e.g., 712246) in the input field
2. Click "Add" to add it to your watchlist
3. Repeat for all pincodes you want to monitor
4. Your selected pins appear in "My Pin Code Watch List"

#### Check for Vaccines
- **Check Now:** Immediately checks vaccine availability at all watchlist pincodes
- **Keep Checking Every 3 HRS:** Enables automatic background checking every 3 hours

Both options check for vaccine availability for the **next 7 days** from the current date.
